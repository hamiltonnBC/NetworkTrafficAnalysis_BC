In here we maintain the config that we used for the Windows and Linux GHOST 
machines.

They are only slightly modified from the defaults; in particular, the chanages 
are in timeline.json (mostly to change the time intervals and clickthrough rate) 
and application.json (mostly to set the API endpoint).

See the GHOSTS repo for the originals:

The LICENSE.md file in this folder is the license distributed with GHOSTS - it 
probably doesn't need to be included here, since these are just configuration 
files, but it doesn't hurt.
